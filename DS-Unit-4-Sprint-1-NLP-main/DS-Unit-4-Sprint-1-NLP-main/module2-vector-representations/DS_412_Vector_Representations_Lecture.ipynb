    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we learned yesterday, machines cannot interpret raw text. We need to transform that text into something we/machines can more readily analyze. Yesterday, we did simple counts of counts to summarize the content of Amazon reviews. Today, we'll extend those concepts to talk about vector representations such as Bag of Words (BoW) and word embedding models. We'll use those representations for search, visualization, and prepare for our classification day tomorrow. \n",
    "\n",
    "Processing text data to prepare it for machine learning models often means translating the information from documents into a numerical format. Bag-of-Words approaches (sometimes referred to as Frequency-Based word embeddings) accomplish this by \"vectorizing\" tokenized documents. This is done by representing each document as a row in a DataFrame and creating a column for each unique word in the corpora (group of documents). The presence or lack of a given word in a document is then represented either as a raw count of how many times a given word appears in a document (CountVectorizer) or as that word's TF-IDF score (TfidfVectorizer).\n",

    "### BoW discards textual context\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the limitations of Bag-of-Words approaches is that any information about the textual context surrounding that word is lost. This also means that with bag-of-words approaches often the only tools that we have for identifying words with similar usage or meaning and subsequently consolidating them into a single vector is through the processes of stemming and lemmatization which tend to be quite limited at consolidating words unless the two words are very close in their spelling or in their root parts-of-speech.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Embedding approaches preserve more textual context\n",
    "Word2Vec is an increasingly popular word embedding technique. Like Bag-of-words it learns a real-value vector representation for a predefined fixed-size vocabulary that is generated from a corpus of text. However, in contrast to BoW, Word2Vec approaches are much more capable of accounting for textual context, and are better at discovering words with similar meanings or usages (semantic or syntactic similarity).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Word2Vec Intuition\n",
    "### The Distribution Hypothesis\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand how Word2Vec preserves textual context we have to understand what's called the Distribution Hypothesis (Reference: Distribution Hypothesis Theory  -https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributional_semantics. The Distribution Hypothesis operates under the assumption that words that have similar contexts will have similar meanings. Practically speaking, this means that if two words are found to have similar words both to the right and to the left of them throughout the corpora then those words have the same context and are assumed to have the same meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "> \"You shall know a word by the company it keeps\" - John Firth\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we let the usage of a word define its meaning and its \"similarity\" to other words. In the following example, which words would you say have a similar meaning? \n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 1**: Traffic was light today\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 2**: Traffic was heavy yesterday\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sentence 3**: Prediction is that traffic will be smooth-flowing tomorrow since it is a national holiday\n",
    "\n",
    "What words in the above sentences seem to have a similar meaning if all you knew about them was the context in which they appeared above? \n",

    "The Skip-Gram method predicts the neighbors’ of a word given a center word. In the skip-gram model, we take a center word and a window of context (neighbors) words to train the model and then predict context words out to some window size for each center word.\n",

    "**Text:**\n",

    "\n",
    "With CountVectorizer and TF-IDF the best we could do for context was to look at common bi-grams and tri-grams (n-grams). Well, skip-grams go far beyond that and give our model much stronger contextual information.\n",

    "\n",
    "This model takes thes opposite approach from the skip-gram model in that it tries to predict a center word based on the neighboring words. In the case of the CBOW model, we input the context words within the window (such as “the”, “Proshe”, “drove”) and aim to predict the target or center word “speedy” (the input to the prediction pipeline is reversed as compared to the SkipGram model).\n",
